    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <section anchor="problem" title="The Problem">
        <t>The DOTS data channel protocol <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel"></xref> is used for bulk data
        exchange between DOTS agents to improve the coordination of parties
        involved in the response to the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
        attack. Filter management is one of its tasks which enables a DOTS
        client to retrieve the filtering capabilities of a DOTS server and to
        manage filtering rules. Typically, these Filtering rules are used for
        dropping or rate-limiting unwanted traffic, and permitting
        accept-listed traffic.</t>

        <t>Unlike the DOTS signal channel protocol <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>, the DOTS data channel
        protocol is not expected to deal with attack conditions. As such, an
        issue that might be encountered in some deployments is when filters
        installed by means of the DOTS data channel protocol may not function
        as expected during DDoS attacks or, worse, exacerbate an ongoing DDoS
        attack. The DOTS data channel protocol cannot be used then to change
        these filters, which may complicate DDoS mitigation operations <xref
        target="Interop"></xref>.</t>

        <t>A typical case is a DOTS client which configures during 'idle' time
        (i.e., no mitigation is active) some filtering rules using the DOTS
        data channel protocol to permit traffic from accept-listed sources,
        but during a volumetric DDoS attack the DDoS mitigator identifies the
        source addresses/prefixes in the accept-listed filtering rules are
        attacking the target. For example, an attacker can spoof the IP
        addresses of accept-listed sources to generate attack traffic or the
        attacker can compromise the accept-listed sources and program them to
        launch a DDoS attack.</t>

        <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> is designed so
        that the DDoS server notifies the conflict to the DOTS client (that
        is, 'conflict-cause' parameter set to 2 (Conflicts with an existing
        accept list)), but the DOTS client may not be able to withdraw the
        accept-list rules during the attack period due to the high-volume
        attack traffic saturating the inbound link to the DOTS client domain.
        In other words, the DOTS client cannot use the DOTS data channel
        protocol to withdraw the accept-list filters when a DDoS attack is in
        progress. This assumes that this DOTS client is the owner of the
        filtering rule.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sol" title="The Solution">
        <t>This specification addresses the problems discussed in <xref
        target="problem"></xref> by adding the capability of managing
        filtering rules using the DOTS signal channel protocol, which enables
        a DOTS client to request the activation (or deactivation) of filtering
        rules during a DDoS attack.</t>

        <t>The DOTS signal channel protocol is designed to enable a DOTS
        client to contact a DOTS server for help even under severe network
        congestion conditions. Therefore, extending the DOTS signal channel
        protocol to manage the filtering rules during an attack will enhance
        the protection capability offered by DOTS protocols.</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>Note: The experiment at the IETF103 hackathon <xref
            target="Interop"></xref> showed that even when the inbound link is
            saturated by DDoS attack traffic, the DOTS client can signal
            mitigation requests using the DOTS signal channel over the
            saturated link.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Conflicts that are induced by filters installed by other DOTS
        clients of the same domain are not discussed in this
        specification.</t>

        <t>Sample examples are provided in <xref target="sample"></xref>, in
        particular: <list style="symbols">
            <t><xref target="sample1"></xref> illustrates how the filter
            control extension is used when conflicts with Access Control List
            (ACLs) are detected and reported by a DOTS server.</t>

            <t><xref target="sample2"></xref> shows how a DOTS client can
            instruct a DOTS server to safely forward some specific traffic in
            'attack' time.</t>

            <t><xref target="sample3"></xref> shows how a DOTS client can
            react if the DDoS traffic is still being forwarded to the DOTS
            client domain even if mitigation requests were sent to a DOTS
            server.</t>

    <section title="Controlling Filtering Rules of a DOTS Client">
      <section anchor="bind" title="Binding DOTS Data and Signal Channels">
        <t>The filtering rules eventually managed using the DOTS signal
        channel protocol are created a priori by the same DOTS client using
        the DOTS data channel protocol. Managing conflicts with filters
        installed by other DOTS clients of the same domain is out of
        scope.</t>

        <t>As discussed in Section 4.4.1 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>, a DOTS client must use
        the same 'cuid' for both the DOTS signal and data channels. This
        requirement is meant to facilitate binding DOTS channels used by the
        same DOTS client.</t>

        <t>The DOTS signal and data channels from a DOTS client may or may not
        use the same DOTS server. Nevertheless, the scope of the mitigation
        request, alias, and filtering rules are not restricted to the DOTS
        server but to the DOTS server domain. To that aim, DOTS servers within
        a domain are assumed to have a mechanism to coordinate the mitigation
        requests, aliases, and filtering rules to coordinate their decisions
        for better mitigation operation efficiency. The exact details about
        such mechanism is out of the scope of this document. </t>

        <t>A filtering rule controlled by the DOTS signal channel is
        identified by its ACL name (Section 7.2 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel"></xref>). Note that an ACL name
        unambiguously identifies an ACL bound to a DOTS client, but the same
        name may be used by distinct DOTS clients.</t>

        <t>The activation or deactivation of an ACL by the DOTS signal channel
        overrides the 'activation-type' (defined in Section 7.2 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel"></xref>) a priori conveyed with
        the filtering rules using the DOTS data channel protocol.</t>

      <section title="DOTS Signal Channel Extension">
        <section anchor="filtering" title="Parameters and Behaviors">
          <t>This specification extends the mitigation request defined in
          Section 4.4.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>
          to convey the intended control of configured filtering rules.
          Concretely, the DOTS client conveys 'acl-list' attribute with the
          following sub-attributes in the CBOR body of a mitigation
          request:<list style="hanging">
              <t hangText="acl-name:">A name of an access list defined using
              the DOTS data channel (Section 7.2 of <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel"></xref>) that is associated
              with the DOTS client.<vspace blankLines="1" />As a reminder, an
              ACL is an ordered list of Access Control Entries (ACE). Each
              Access Control Entry has a list of match criteria and a list of
              actions <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel"></xref>. The
              list of configured ACLs can be retrieved using the DOTS data
              channel during 'idle' time.<vspace blankLines="1" /> This is an
              optional attribute.</t>

              <t hangText="activation-type:">Indicates the activation type of
              an ACL overriding the existing 'activation-type' installed by
              the DOTS client using the DOTS data channel. <vspace

              <vspace blankLines="1" />Note that both 'immediate' and
              'activate-when-mitigating' have an immediate effect when a
              mitigation request is being processed by the DOTS server.

            </list></t>

          <t>By default, ACL-related operations are achieved using the DOTS
          data channel protocol when no attack is ongoing. During an attack
          time, a DOTS client may include 'acl-list', 'acl-name', and
          'activation-type' attributes in a mitigation request having a new or
          an existing 'mid'. When such attributes are to be included in a
          mitigation request with an existing 'mid', the DOTS client MUST
          repeat all the other parameters as sent in the original mitigation
          request (i.e., having that 'mid') apart from a possible change to
          the lifetime parameter value.</t>

          <t>It is RECOMMENDED for a DOTS client to subscribe to asynchronous
          notifications of the attack mitigation, as detailed in Section
          4.4.2.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>. If
          not, the polling mechanism in Section 4.4.2.2 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> has to be followed by
          the DOTS client.</t>

          <t>A DOTS client relies on the information received from the DOTS
          server and/or local information to the DOTS client domain to trigger
          a filter control request. Only filters that are pertinent for an
          ongoing mitigation should be controlled by a DOTS client using the
          DOTS signal channel.</t>

          <t>The 'activation-type' is a comprehension-required parameter. The
          'acl-list' and 'acl-name' parameters are defined as
          comprehension-required parameters in Table 6 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>. Following the rules
          in Section 6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>,
          if the DOTS server does not understand the 'acl-list' or 'acl-name'
          or 'activation-type' attributes, it responds with a "4.00 (Bad
          Request)" error response code.</t>

          <t>If the DOTS server does not find the ACL name conveyed in the
          mitigation request for this DOTS client, it MUST respond with 4.04
          (Not Found) error response code.</t>

          <t>If the DOTS server finds the ACL name for this DOTS client, and
          assuming the request passed the validation checks in Section 4.4.1
          of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>, the DOTS
          server MUST proceed with the 'activation-type' update. The update is
          immediately enforced by the DOTS server and will be maintained as
          the new activation type for the ACL name even after the termination
          of the mitigation request. In addition, the DOTS server MUST update
          the lifetime of the corresponding ACL similar to the update when a
          refresh request is received using the DOTS data channel (Section 7.2
          of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel"></xref>).</t>

          <t>If, during an active mitigation, the 'activation-type' is changed
          at the DOTS server (e.g., as a result of an external action) for an
          ACL bound to a DOTS client, the DOTS server notifies that DOTS
          client with the change by including the corresponding ACL parameters
          in an asynchronous notification (the DOTS client is observing the
          active mitigation) or in a response to a polling request (Section
          4.4.2.2 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>).</t>

          <t>If the DOTS signal and data channels maintained by a DOTS client
          are not terminated on the same DOTS server of a DOTS server domain,
          the above request processing operations are undertaken using the
          coordination mechanism discussed in <xref target="bind"></xref>.
          </t>

          <t>This specification does not require any modification to the
          efficacy update and the withdrawal procedures defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref>. In particular,
          ACL-related clauses are not included in a PUT request used to send
          an efficacy update and DELETE requests.</t>

        <t>Assuming the DOTS client subscribed to asynchronous notifications,
        when the DOTS server concludes that some of the attack sources belong
        to 2001:db8:1234::/48, it sends a notification message with 'status'
        code set to '1 (Attack mitigation is in progress)' and
        'conflict-cause' set to '2' (conflict-with-acceptlist) to the DOTS
        client to indicate that this mitigation request is in progress, but a
        conflict is detected.</t>

        <t>Upon receipt of the notification message from the DOTS server, the
        DOTS client sends a PUT request to deactivate the "an-accept-list" ACL

        <t>The DOTS client can also decide to send a PUT request to deactivate
        the "an-accept-list" ACL, if suspect traffic is received from an
        accept-listed source (2001:db8:1234::/48). The structure of that PUT

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel"></xref> need to be taken into
      account.</t>

      <t>A DOTS client is entitled to access only to resources it creates. In
      particular, a DOTS client can not tweak filtering rules created by other
      DOTS clients of the same DOTS client domain.</t>

      <t>A compromised DOTS client can use the filtering control capability to
      exacerbate an ongoing attack. Likewise, such compromised DOTS client may
      abstain from reacting to an ACL conflict notification received from the
      DOTS server during attacks. These are not new attack vectors, but
      variations of threats discussed in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-signal-channel"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dots-data-channel"></xref>. DOTS operators should
      carefully monitor and audit DOTS agents to detect misbehaviors and to
      deter misuses.</t>
